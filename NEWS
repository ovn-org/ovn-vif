OVN VIF v21.12.1 - xx xxx xxxx
------------------------------
  - Introduced runtime update of lookup tables.  Before this change lookup
    tables were populated on initial startup of the ovn-controller only, and as
    such any representors created after ovn-controller startup would not be
    available until restart of the ovn-controller.  Systems using systemd and
    udev should install libudev header- and library- files prior to compiling
    ovn-vif to enable handling of systemd predictable network interface name
    functionality.

OVN VIF v21.12.0 - 23 Dec 2021
